# JPEG decoder

The goal of this project was to realize in the C language a decoder from scratch which converts images in a compressed format (JPEG) to a raw format (Portable Pixmap).

This work was done as part of the 3-weeks C project in the first year of engineering courses at Grenoble INP - Ensimag, UGA.
